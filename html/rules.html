<p><strong>SERVER RULES</strong></p>
<p>0) Use common sense. Being ignorant or just plain stupid is not an excuse. </p>
<p>1) Desert Rose is a High Roleplay server. You are expected to RP first and foremost, and to uphold the suspension of disbelief and play a character that could believably be found in a Fallout game. This includes having character names that fit within the Fallout universe.</p>
<p>2) Abusing in-game mechanics to get out of a roleplay scene runs contrary to the spirit of the game. This includes but is not limited to: </p>
<p>- Ganking / Kill-on-Sight / Random Deathmatch</p>
<p>- Interfering with SSD players in any negative way, shape or form. The only acceptable actions toward an SSD is to take them to a safe bed, or leave them alone.</p>
<p>- Hoarding powerful tech as any faction but BOS or Enclave. Hoarding is defined as collecting resources for the sole purpose of keeping them from the rest of the map.</p>
<p>- Joining as a role and then deserting your faction without good reason. An example of a good reason would be if the NCR Captain orders a warcrime.</p>
<p>- Deliberately pulling or training enemies onto other players.</p>
<p>- Intentionally breaking into someone's locked settlement to steal all their items while they're AFK.</p>
<p>3) Escalation of violence is required in all situations, regardless of faction. You are here to roleplay, not click each other until blood comes out. Murder is only acceptable as an RP choice that furthers the story for all players involved; you are allowed to capture players and torture them to death or execute them in creative ways so long as it tells an interesting story. The game is intended to have a cinematic feeling of a story being told by all the players collaboratively, rather than being a wasteland deathmatch. However, there will always be situations where immediate violence is required, and escalation can help keep things on a fair level and preserve player enjoyment.</p>
<p>Escalation should go from, at minimum: </p>
<p>- Verbal argument </p>
<p>- Weapons drawn, aggressive language or threatening /me actions</p>
<p>- Use of violent force (attacking with fists, grabbing and throwing, etc)</p>
<p>- Use of deadly force (attacking with any kind of weapon)</p>
<p>At each stage the escalation should be done only if the other is willing; do not escalate from throwing punches to drawing your gun and shooting them if they have backed off to continue talking. Walking up to someone with your weapon out and screaming for them to get on the ground, then shooting them if they don’t immediately comply, does not follow escalation and is not allowed.</p>
<p>Each stage of escalation should be reciprocated. Drawing a weapon on someone as a threat and killing them when they talk back would be considered unfair play. Generally murder on the spot is to be considered a last resort.</p>
<p>Escalation is maintained between encounters. If a player manages to escape from someone that was shooting at them with intent to kill, that player is allowed to recognize that someone at a later time and respond with the same level of violence.</p>
<p>End of Round does not mean that escalation can be bypassed; there is no End of Round Grief allowed.</p>
<p>3a) Wasteland Justice is acceptable. If someone is hostile to you, steals from you, grabs the object you’re pulling, or treats you badly in a way that anyone would recognize, this is considered the beginning of escalation, and can result in a more aggressive response.</p>
<p>3b) If you have someone captive, you are required to roleplay with them. Locking someone alone in a room, or forcing them to complete a repetitive task, is not roleplay. If you have captured someone for the sole purpose of torturing or executing them, it is advised to check LOOC if the player is willing first. If you plan on having someone captive long term, it is your responsibility to make sure their experience in the round is not ruined.</p>
<p>4) Raiders or other antagonistic characters should be on the server in order to drive roleplay forward. Antagonists are expected to provide a story-based threat, not merely a mechanics-based one. If you are playing an "evil" character, you are required to have proper motive behind your actions, and killing must be a last resort. A player with an evil character would be required to roleplay with their victims by capturing them prior to harming them. Both sides must observe escalation during the capture and subsequent roleplay, however a captive player is allowed to fight back at an equal level; if a captive if allowed to get hold of a weapon, it is reasonable to expect them to use it on their captor.</p>
<p>5) If you are playing a faction, you are required to know the lore of that faction. By signing up for these roles you agree to follow the lore and canonical rules for these factions, or else face a ban or IC punishment at any time. This includes the BOS’s Chain that Binds, the NCR’s laws, and the Legion’s beliefs. </p>
<p>-Consciously hindering your faction (i.e breaking their laws/doctrines/beliefs for your own gain & at the cost of others) without proper RP is not allowed.</p>
<p>- Non-canon Factions, such as Wastelanders and Settlers, are allowed to be played without knowledge of Fallout's canon, however it is strongly encouraged to know at least the basics. You are allowed to play someone who does not know where they are or what is going on, but strongly encouraged to find a way to roleplay that (brain damage, amnesia, ignorant tribal, etc).</p>
<p>- Non-human characters are required to know the lore of the species they are playing, without exception.</p>
<p>- Raids on faction bases must receive admin permission, with no exceptions. Raiding is defined as any focused destructive act, such as looting, damaging buildings or machines, and killing players without roleplay. Raids may not begin before one hour of in-game time has passed.</p>
<p>6) While this is an English speaking server, you are allowed to speak other languages in character. However, if you are unable to communicate OOCly with admins, success is not guaranteed. You are required to at least attempt to make yourself understood through /me actions before escalating even when playing a non-English speaker.</p>
<p>7) You are strongly encouraged to ahelp with any questions, concerns, requests, or problems. If there are no admins online, you may ping one of the online staff on discord. Make sure to include the round ID in your reports, it is required to fetch logs.</p>
<p>- Mass pings to staff are to be reserved for server-breaking issues. If you ping more than one staff member at a time and it is not an emergency, you may face a temporary mute.</p>
<p>- Most reasonable requests will be honored, but don't push your luck. </p>
<p>8) While this server does host NSFW content, players are allowed to opt out of scenes that make them uncomfortable. Good faith requests to end a scene in LOOC should generally be respected when possible.</p>
<p><strong>CODE OF CONDUCT</strong></p>
<p>Behavior on both the game server and discord is held to a standard that dictates interpersonal conflict be kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>To maintain a relaxed and friendly atmosphere, certain behaviors have been prohibited.</p>
<p>Prohibited behaviors include:</p>
<p>- The use of slurs against any minority or group</p>
<p>- Hostility between players in OOC or DSay</p>
<p>- Abusive language and name-calling</p>
<p>- Negativity directed towards a group or fandom (anime, furry, other servers)</p>
<p>- Political discussion</p>
